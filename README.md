User Story #1
Create a class structure that mimics a deck of cards. Remember decks as well as a hand of cards are made up of cards. Feel free to create the structure in any way you see fit. hint We did a lab in Chapter 6 of this week that dealt with a deck of cards.

User Story #2
Add methods and fields to your classes that mimic the functionality of shuffling and dealing a deck of cards. Remember that when a card is dealt you have to remove it from the current deck! You should be able to print out a shuffled deck to the terminal.

User Story #3
Deal two hands of cards one to a Dealer and another to a Player. Allow the players to Hit (add cards to their hand) or Stay (not add cards to their hand) in accordance to the rules of blackjack shown in the wiki. Do not worry about the multiple values for Ace until your basic game logic is working. Assume they are either 1 or 11 to start.
